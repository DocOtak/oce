It is difficult to download these data since MEDS seems to supply only a GUI system.

At one time, this worked:

http://www.meds-sdmm.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/isdm-gdsi/twl-mne/inventory-inventaire/download-telecharger.asp?File=E:\iusr_tmpfiles\TWL\490-1-JAN-2003_slev.csv\&Name=490-1-JAN-2003_slev.csv\&Size=159411

but it failed when I tried it on 2018-03-13. I can download the data by
clicking the link, but if I save that link in Safari I get

http://www.isdm-gdsi.gc.ca/isdm-gdsi/twl-mne/inventory-inventaire/download-telecharger.asp?File=E:\iusr_tmpfiles\TWL\490-01-JAN-2003_slev.csv&Name=490-01-JAN-2003_slev.csv&Size=159411

which doesn't seem to be a link I can use permanently. Thanks, MEDS, way to go, buddy.
