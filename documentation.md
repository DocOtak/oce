The Oce vignette provides a good starting point.  To get it, install Oce and
then type `vignette("oce")` in an R console.

Dan Kelley and Clark Richards are preparing to write a paper about the use
of Oce, although the journal has not yet been selected.  One natural journal for
    an in-depth exposition might be <a
        href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-geosciences/">Computers
        and Geosciences</a>.  The AGU EOS Transactions and the <a
    href="http://www.cmos.ca/site/cmos_bulletin">CMOS Bulletin</a> both seem
like good choices for briefer introductions.

Dan Kelley's [blog](http://dankelley.github.io/blog) has many items relating to
Oce.  In late 2018, he published a book entitled <i>Oceanographic Analysis with
R</i> is available from the publisher, <a
href="https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493988426">Springer</a>, and other
sources, e.g.  <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Oceanographic-Analysis-R-Dan-Kelley/dp/1493988425/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1538313197&sr=8-1&keywords=dan+e+kelley&dpID=31BCT11P-rL&preST=_SY344_BO1,204,203,200_QL70_&dpSrc=srch">Amazon</a>.
A provisional table of contents (from his pre-publication draft) is given
