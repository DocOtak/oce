Oce is an R package for processing oceanographic data, and the ``gh-pages`` git
branch holds the source of its webpage, hosted on github.com and coded using
the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) web system.

Note that this website is written in html, not markdown. What makes it jekyll
is the use of the three-hyphen blocks at the start of the .html files; these
are clues to jekyll about how to represent and interlink the pages. As for the
actual content of those pages, though, it's html so one has to use the
angle-bracket notation for highlighting and links.  This could be changed but
there seems to be little benefit, now that the content is mostly written. (The
problem is that writing in markdown requires an extra step before pushing to
github; jekyll has to be invoked to create html files, copy them into
appropriate subdirectories, etc. This step is easy to forget.)
