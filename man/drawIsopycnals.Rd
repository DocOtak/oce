\title{Add Isopycnal Curves to TS Plot}
\usage{
drawIsopycnals(
  nlevels = 6,
  levels,
  rotate = TRUE,
  rho1000 = FALSE,
  digits = 2,
  eos = getOption("oceEOS", default = "gsw"),
  extrapolateIsopycnals = FALSE,
  cex = 0.75 * par("cex"),
  col = "darkgray",
  lwd = par("lwd"),
  lty = par("lty")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nlevels}{suggested number of density levels (i.e. isopycnal curves);
ignored if \code{levels} is supplied.}

\item{levels}{optional density levels to draw.}

\item{rotate}{boolean, set to \code{TRUE} to write all density labels
horizontally.}

\item{rho1000}{boolean, set to \code{TRUE} to write isopycnal labels as e.g.
1024 instead of 24.}

\item{digits}{number of decimal digits to use in label (supplied to
\code{\link[=round]{round()}}).}

\item{eos}{equation of state to be used, either \code{"unesco"} or
\code{"gsw"}.}

\item{extrapolateIsopycnals}{logical value (\code{FALSE} by default) that
indicates whether to extrapolate the isopycnal curves
beyond a temperature-salinity domain that is considered valid.
For \code{eos="unesco"}, the valid region spans salinities from 0 to 42
and temperatures from -2C to 40C (see page 23 of Fofonoff and Millard, 1983).
For \code{eos="gsw"}, the appropriate valid range is somewhat uncertain, owing to
contradictions between the foundational research paper (McDougall et al.
2003, section 3) and the TEOS-10/gsw code. In the present function,
the permitted Absolute Salinity range is taken to be 0 g/kg to 42 g/kg, which
matches the "funnel" used in the TEOS-10/gsw code as of July 2020,
but it should be noted that \code{\link[gsw:gsw_SA_from_rho]{gsw::gsw_SA_from_rho()}} can handle values up to 50 g/kg,
perhaps suggesting a larger range of validity.  Another point of confusion is
the range of Conservative Temperature valididity.  The "funnel" returned
by the TEOS-10/gsw matlab function \code{gsw_infunnel()} does not set an upper limit
on surface Conservative Temperature, but that makes no physical sense, and so
the present function chooses to follow McDougall et al. (2003 section 3)
in setting 33C as an upper limit on surface Conservative Temperature.}

\item{cex}{size for labels.}

\item{col}{color for lines and labels.}

\item{lwd}{line width for isopycnal curves}

\item{lty}{line type for isopycnal curves}
}
\value{
None.
}
\description{
Adds isopycnal lines to an existing temperature-salinity plot.  This is
called by \code{\link[=plotTS]{plotTS()}}, and may be called by the user also, e.g. if
an image plot is used to show TS data density.
